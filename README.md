# PythonProjects

This repository is a collection of Python projects demonstrating various applications of Python in solving real-world problems and experimenting with artificial intelligence concepts. Below are the highlights of the projects included in this repository.

## Projects

### Aquatic Non-Indigenous Species Distribution

- **Description**: A Python script that leverages the US Geological Survey's Nonindigenous Aquatic Species (NAS) database alongside GeoPandas to create a visual representation of the geographic distribution of nonindigenous aquatic species since the 20th century, outputted as a GIF. This project involved extensive research on Git command-line usage to manage and publish a database containing over 500,000 records on GitHub.
- **Technologies Used**: Python, GeoPandas, US Geological Survey NAS database, Git
- **Visualization**:

  This GIF showcases the distribution of nonindigenous aquatic species over time, visually representing the spread across different states.

### Monty Hall Problem AI

- **Description**: This project develops an AI that applies reinforcement learning techniques to solve the Monty Hall problem, aiming to maximize the probability of success. By recreating the famous Monty Hall problem, the AI learns to make decisions that prioritize higher chances of winning.
- **Technologies Used**: Python, reinforcement learning
